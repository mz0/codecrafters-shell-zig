U: Review doc/design.md, tell me if the project goals are clear, ask me to fill gaps if any.
U: Signal handling (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D) - added note, other points of confusion addressed, the list of features is exhastive now.
C: The project goals are now clear. The document defines:
  * Scope: Codecrafters shell challenge in Zig
  * Builtins: cd, echo, exit, history, pwd, type
  * Features: PATH lookup, TAB completion, pipes, STDOUT/STDERR redirection, history persistence
  * Quoting/escaping: Well-defined rules for single quotes, double quotes, and backslash
  * Signals: Ctrl+C and Ctrl+D behavior
  * Constraints: No external libraries, custom terminal/line-editor
  The feature list is exhaustive and unambiguous. Ready to implement.

U: First write me implementation plan / design overview. In Markdown files, so I can review and comment.
C: doc/implementation-plan.md , doc/module-design.md (Crunched for 1m 2s)

U: LGTM, though I'd move  Terminal Raw Mode (maybe without TAB/Arrows handling) earlier, so the main loop structure does not mutate much later. Open Q's answered.
C: Done. Updated both documents. Ready for your review. (Sautéed for 1m 21s) [though document updatyed, actual execution not affected ??]

U: changed `history -r` semantics and implementation method, added `history <N>` description to design.md
C: Updated module-design.md - Documents are in sync.

U: Ok, let's do Phases 1-2.
C: ... Phases 1-2 complete. Ready for Phase 3 (Tokenizer) when you want to continue. (Baked for 5m 19s)

U: Program should receive argv[0] unmodified (no full path prepended). That would fix Codecrafters test error:
     [tester::#IP1] Expected: "Arg #0 (program name): custom_exe_7628"
     [tester::#IP1] Received: "Arg #0 (program name): /tmp/pig/custom_exe_7628"
   Please update design.md with this point
C: Done. Fixed executor.zig to pass original command name as argv[0] and documented this in doc/design.md. (Crunched for 2m 0s)

U: Change error message wording to match test expectations:
     Expected: "cd: /non-existing-directory: No such file or directory"
     Received: "cd: /non-existing-directory: FileNotFound"
C: Fixed.

U: Phase 3
C: Phase 3 complete. 3 Tests ... PASS. (Churned for 2m 16s)

U: Phase 4
C: Let me implement Phase 4: Redirections... Zig std.process.Child doesn't support redirecting to a file directly. I need to use manual fork/dup2/exec..
   Phase 4 complete. (Baked for 7m 18s)

U: Let's jump to Phase 8: TAB-completion.
C: Phase 8 requires terminal raw mode and line editor first. Let me implement these together. (Worked for 32s, You've hit your limit · resets in 2 hours)

U: Do Phase 8 (TAB-completion) in baby-steps: see implementation-plan.md Milestone 1, 2, 3 in Phase 8. Pause after reaching a milestone and let me check it.
C: Milestone 1 complete. (Brewed for 6m 51s)

U: works, do Milestone 2
C: Milestone 2 complete. (Cogitated for 2m 9s)
